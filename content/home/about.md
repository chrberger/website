# Biography

Dr. Christian Berger is Associate Professor at in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. He received his Ph.D. from RWTH Aachen University, Germany for his work on software engineering for self-driving vehicles together with academic and industrial partners like University of California, Berkeley in California and Volkswagen Group. His research expertise is on distributed software systems, embedded systems, and continuous integration/deployment/experimentation for cyber-physical systems. He coordinated the interdisciplinary project for the development of the autonomously driving vehicle "Caroline", which participated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge Final in the United States. He supported Chalmers Truck Team to develop a self-driving vehicle for the 2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge in The Netherlands. Currently, he is coordinating research projects on self-driving vehicles at Chalmers and University of Gothenburg in Sweden like COPPLAR, a platform to conduct research around self-driving functionality in inner-city-like environments.
