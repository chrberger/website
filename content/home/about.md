Dr. Christian Berger is Associate Professor and Docent for Software Engineering at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/Pages/default.aspx) at [University of Gothenburg](http://www.gu.se/), Sweden. His research focuses on systematically architecting complex software and systems embracing continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and continuous experimentation (CE) for a growingly automated and digitalized society.

He is an expert for self-driving vehicles with over a decade of experience:

* Coordinating "Team CarOLO" ([summary](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.20254/abstract;jsessionid=588CF40CB069522E22ED96E8C7F8C156.f03t01)|[videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB3E9410B8EE768BA)) from Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany - the best European contestant at the [2007 DARPA Urban Challenge](http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/)
* Collaborating with Berkeley's Drive Lab ([summary](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2373v1.pdf))
* Supervising student teams from Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg at [CaroloCup](https://wiki.ifr.ing.tu-bs.de/carolocup/) student competition for self-driving miniature cars: [2013](https://www.chalmers.se/en/news/Pages/Students-won-competition-for-mini-cars.aspx) (first prize), [2014](http://nyhetsbrev.viktoria.se/team-legendary-and-team-tetrix-from-chalmers-and-university-of-gothenburg-are-among-top-three-newcomer-teams-in-self-driving-miniature-vehicles-student-competition-carolocup-in-germa/), [2015](http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/news/Pages/Carolo-Cup-2015.aspx), 2016, 2017
* Supporting "[Chalmers Truck Team](https://www.chalmers.se/en/news/Pages/Self-driving-trucks-2016.aspx)" at [2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge](http://www.gcdc.net/en/) (first prize for best HMI)
* Co-coordinating the research project [COPPLAR](http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/s2/news/Pages/COPPLAR-start2016.aspx) to develop a self-driving vehicle for urban scenarios
* Supporting Wallenberg Autonomous Systems and Software Program ([WASP](http://wasp-sweden.org)) as member of the [Graduate School Management Group](http://wasp-sweden.org/about/graduate-school-management-group/) and the [Demonstrator Management Group](http://wasp-sweden.org/about/demonstrator-management-group/)

He is the lead engineer for the distributed realtime middleware [OpenDaVINCI](http://www.opendavinci.org) ([docs](http://docs.opendavinci.org)|[tutorials](http://docs.opendavinci.org/tutorials.html)|[source](http://code.opendavinci.org)|[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/seresearch/opendavinci-ubuntu-16.04-complete/tags/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenDaVINCI)) and jointly leads the design and development of the open source platform Open Driverless Vehicle ([OpenDLV](http://opendlv.org/)) ([source](https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv.core/)|[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/seresearch/opendlv-core-on-opendavinci-ubuntu-16.04-complete/tags/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenDLV)). This software powers research projects at Chalmers vehicle laboratory [Revere](http://www.chalmers.se/en/researchinfrastructure/revere/Pages/default.aspx).
