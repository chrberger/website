His research focuses on systematically architecting complex software and systems embracing continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation.

He is an expert for self-driving vehicles with over a decade of experience from various projects:

* Coordinating "Team CarOLO" from Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany - the best European contestant at [2007 DARPA Urban Challenge](http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/)
* Collaboration with University of California, Berkeley's [Autonomous Ground Vehicles](https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/agv/overview/) group
* Supporting "[Chalmers Truck Team](https://www.chalmers.se/en/news/Pages/Self-driving-trucks-2016.aspx)" at [2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge](http://www.gcdc.net/en/)
* Supervising student teams at [CaroloCup](https://wiki.ifr.ing.tu-bs.de/carolocup/) student competition for self-driving miniature cars: [2013](https://www.chalmers.se/en/news/Pages/Students-won-competition-for-mini-cars.aspx) (first prize), [2014](http://nyhetsbrev.viktoria.se/team-legendary-and-team-tetrix-from-chalmers-and-university-of-gothenburg-are-among-top-three-newcomer-teams-in-self-driving-miniature-vehicles-student-competition-carolocup-in-germa/), [2015](http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/news/Pages/Carolo-Cup-2015.aspx), 2016
* Co-coordinating the research project [COPPLAR](http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/s2/news/Pages/COPPLAR-start2016.aspx) to develop a self-driving vehicle for urban scenarios
* Lead engineer for [OpenDaVINCI](http://code.opendavinci.org) and [OpenDLV](http://opendlv.org/), the [open source software](https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv.core/) that powers research projects at Chalmers vehicle laboratory [Revere](http://www.chalmers.se/en/researchinfrastructure/revere/Pages/default.aspx)
