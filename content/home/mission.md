# Vision & Mission

We are entering a time, in which companies distribute software-driven products
to customers and continuously stay in touch with these products afterwards.

This facilitates a better understanding of typical product usage in the field,
faster fixing of problems, and extending the functionality during a product's life-time.

Our team focuses on research around demands for system and software design,
architecture, and deployment to efficiently engineer the software and systems
for an increasingly automated and digitalized world.
