# Vision & Mission

More and more products for our daily life are driven by software that is
simultaneously processing and producing a growing amount of surrounding data.

A self-driving vehicle is a [perfect example](http://sites.ieee.org/connected-vehicles/2016/11/15/intel-announces-250-million-investment-autonomous-driving/) for a system that has to deal with an
increasing amount of realtime data but that also benefits from enormous amounts
of [data from the past for machine learning](http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/why-ai-makes-selfdriving-cars-hard-to-prove-safe).

Therefore, a self-driving car needs to be perceived as a "data center on robotic wheels",
where appropriate engineering, maintenance, and innovation methods are required. 

Our team focuses on research around challenges for system and software design,
architecture, and deployment to efficiently engineer the software and systems
for our increasingly automated and digitalized society.
