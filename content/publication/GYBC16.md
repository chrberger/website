title = "Continuous Experimentation on Cyber-Physical Systems: Challenges and Opportunities"
abstract = "Establishing and mastering continuous experimentation as an instrument in the portfolio of software product managers is of growing importance resulting in continuous renewal of products for continuous user satisfaction. Product managers for purely software-based products like web-based applications found in online web-shops or smartphone apps can monitor usage profiles of their products in the context of their customers' usage (i.e. the "field"). However, in the area of interconnected embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, or with Internet-of-Things (IoT), such continuous experimentation is under-explored and in many cases understandably not considered due to safety considerations. In this position paper, we are outlining challenges and opportunities of continuous experimentation for cyber-physical systems."
