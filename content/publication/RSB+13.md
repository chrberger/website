title = "Evaluating long-term predictive power of standard reliability growth models on automotive systems"
abstract = "Software is today an integral part of providing improved functionality and innovative features in the automotive industry. Safety and reliability are important requirements for automotive software and software testing is still the main source of ensuring dependability of the software artifacts. Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) have been long used to assess the reliability of software systems; they are also used for predicting the defect inflow in order to allocate maintenance resources. Although a number of models have been proposed and evaluated, much of the assessment of their predictive ability is studied for short term (e.g. last 10% of data). But in practice (in industry) the usefulness of SRGMs with respect to optimal resource allocation depends heavily on the long term predictive power of SRGMs i.e. much before the project is close to completion. The ability to reasonably predict the expected defect inflow provides important insight that can help project and quality managers to take necessary actions related to testing resource allocation on time to ensure high quality software at the release. In this paper we evaluate the long-term predictive power of commonly used SRGMs on four software projects from the automotive sector. The results indicate that Gompertz and Logistic model performs best among the tested models on all fit criterias as well as on predictive power, although these models are not reliable for long-term prediction with partial data."
