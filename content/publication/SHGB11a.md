title = "Formal specification and systematic model-driven testing of embedded automotive systems"
abstract = "Increasingly intelligent energy-management and safety systems are developed to realize safe and economic automobiles. The realization of these systems is only possible with complex and distributed software. This development poses a challenge for verification and validation. Upcoming standards like ISO 26262 provide requirements for verification and validation during development phases. Advanced test methods are requested for safety critical functions. Formal specification of requirements and appropriate testing strategies in different stages of the development cycle are part of it. In this paper we present our approach to formalize the requirements specification by test models. These models serve as basis for the following testing activities, including the automated derivation of executable test cases from it. Test cases can be derived statistically, randomly on the basis of operational profiles, and deterministically in order to be able to perform different testing strategies. We have applied our approach in cooperation with a large German OEM in different development stages of active safety and energy management functionalities. The test cases were executed in model-in-the-loop and in hardware-in-the-loop simulation. With our approach errors were identified both in the requirement specification and in the implementation that were not discovered before."
