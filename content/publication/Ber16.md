title = "Encapsulated Software Build Environments on the Example of a Self-Driving Heavy Vehicle"
abstract = "The mission of Chalmers Resource for Vehicle Research (Revere) laboratory is to provide state-of-the-art vehicular technology and support to enable and conduct research around automated driving ranging from fundamental algorithms up to complex experiments at the proving AstaZero. Our vehicle laboratory houses a Volvo XC90, a Volvo FH 16, and a fleet of self-driving scaled cars. As a resource accessible to different research groups at Chalmers, where different functionality with varying goals needs to be realized and tested, a software engineering process is required supporting this flexibility while preserving basic platform functionality. In this paper, we are reporting about our experience from using encapsulated software build environments to easily include new developers on the one hand and to achieve seamless deployment to the vehicular environment."
