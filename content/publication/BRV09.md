title = "Extensible Validation Framework for DSLs using MontiCore on the Example of Coding Guidelines"
abstract = "Unit test environments are today's state of the art for many programming languages to keep the software's quality above a certain level. However, the software's syntactic quality necessary for the developers themselves is not covered by the aforementioned frameworks. This paper presents a tool realized using the DSL framework MontiCore for automatically validating easily extensible coding guidelines for any domain specific language or even general purpose languages like C++ and its application in an automotive R&D project where a German OEM and several suppliers were involved. Moreover, it was exemplary applied on UML/P-based sequence charts as well."
