title = "Software-Related Challenges of Testing Automated Vehicles"
abstract = "Automated vehicles are not supposed to fail at any time or in any situations during driving. Thus, vehicle manufactures and proving ground operators are challenged to complement existing test procedures with means to systematically evaluate automated driving. In this paper, we explore softwarerelated challenges from testing the safety of automated vehicles. We report on findings from conducting focus groups and interviews including 26 participants (e.g., vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, and researchers) from five countries."
