title = "Design and Evaluation of a Customizable Multi-Domain Reference Architecture on top of Product Lines of Self-Driving Heavy Vehicles - An Industrial Case Study"
abstract = "Self-driving vehicles for commercial use cases like logistics or overcast mines increase their owners' economic competitiveness. Volvo maintains, evolves, and distributes a vehicle control product line for different brands like Volvo Trucks, Renault, and Mack in more than 190 markets world-wide. From the different application domains of their customers originates the need for a multi-domain reference architecture concerned with transport mission planning, execution, and tracking on top of the vehicle control product line. This industrial case study is the first of its kind reporting about the systematic process to design such a reference architecture involving all relevant external and internal stakeholders, development documents, low-level artifacts, and literature. Quantitative and qualitative metrics were applied to evaluate non-functional requirements on the reference architecture level before a concrete variant was evaluated using a Volvo FMX truck in an exemplary construction site setting."
