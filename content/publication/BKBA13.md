title = "An Interdisciplinary Perspective to the Design and Decision Support of Integral Safety Systems"
abstract = "Next generation integral safety systems are expected to provide better protection against traffic accidents by interlinking sensors and actuators of active and passive safety. A series of advanced functions will be used to mitigate collisions and if they cannot be avoided they will at least reduce their severity. We explore the interplay between key technology areas towards a holistic approach in the design and decision support of integral safety systems. First, we refer to the main problems in the design of effective systems and the associated software engineering challenges. Recent advances in sensor data analytics are then explored and their integration with decision support for vehicle control is examined. Finally, we envision that rigorous design techniques based on models for human-machine interaction are essential for achieving adequate performance and robustness of integral safety systems.
