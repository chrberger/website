title = "Adaptive Message Restructuring Using Model-Driven Engineering"
abstract = "Message exchange between distributed software components in cyber-physical systems is a frequent and resource-demanding activity. Existing data description languages simply map user-specified messages literally to the system implementation creating the data stream that is exchanged between the software components; however, our research shows that the exchanged information is often redundant and would allow for runtime optimization. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach for adaptive message restructuring. Taking both design-time properties and runtime properties into account, we propose to dynamically restructure user-specified messages to achieve better resource usage (e.g., reduced latency). Our model-based workflow also includes formal verification of adaptive message restructuring in the presence of complex data flow. This is demonstrated by an automotive example."
