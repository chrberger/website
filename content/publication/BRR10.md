title = "Measuring the Ability to Form a Product Line from Existing Products"
abstract = "A product line approach can save valuable resources by reusing artifacts. Especially for software artifacts, the reuse of existing components is highly desirable. In recent literature, the creation of software product lines is mainly proposed from a top-down point of view regarding features which are visible by customers. In practice, however, the design for a product line often arises from one or few existing products that descend from a very first product starting with copy-paste and evolving individually. In this contribution, we propose the theoretical basis to derive a set of metrics for evaluating similar software products in an objective manner. These metrics are used to evaluate the set of products' ability to form a product line."
